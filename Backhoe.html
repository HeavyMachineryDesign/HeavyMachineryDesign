        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>A backhoe, often called a backhoe loader, is a versatile piece of heavy machinery widely used in construction, excavation, and landscaping. It combines the functionality of two essential tools: a tractor-like loader on the front and a hydraulic excavator arm on the back, which allows it to handle a range of tasks effectively.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="key-features">
        <h1>Key Features</h1>
        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>1. Dual Functionality</h2>
            <p>A backhoe loader combines two primary tools in one machine: a <strong>front loader</strong> and a <strong>backhoe arm</strong>. This dual functionality enables it to handle a range of tasks such as digging, scooping, lifting, loading, and carrying materials, all with a single piece of equipment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>2. Backhoe Arm</h2>
            <p>The <strong>backhoe arm</strong> is located at the rear of the machine and is the main digging tool. It consists of a boom, stick, and bucket that work together to dig into the ground. Powered by a <strong>hydraulic system</strong>, the arm pulls material towards the machine, allowing for precise excavation. It can also reach over obstacles, making it versatile for various digging and trenching tasks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>3. Loader Bucket (Front Loader)</h2>
            <p>Located at the front, the <strong>loader bucket</strong> is designed for scooping and lifting materials like soil, gravel, or debris. It can be used to transport loose material, fill holes, and even clear spaces, making it an ideal tool for moving materials around the job site.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>4. Operator Cab with Pivoting Seat</h2>
            <p>The operator cab often has a <strong>pivoting seat</strong>, allowing the driver to face either the loader in the front or the backhoe arm at the rear. This setup improves efficiency and convenience, as the operator can switch quickly between tasks without needing to move the entire machine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>5. Hydraulic System</h2>
            <p>A powerful <strong>hydraulic system</strong> drives both the backhoe arm and loader bucket, providing strength and precision to lift and dig heavy loads. The hydraulic system is essential for operating attachments smoothly, ensuring that the backhoe can perform demanding tasks like digging hard ground or lifting large loads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>6. Attachments Compatibility</h2>
            <p>Backhoes are compatible with various attachments, such as <strong>augers, hydraulic hammers, rippers, and compactors</strong>, enhancing their versatility. These attachments allow the backhoe to perform specialized tasks beyond digging and loading, such as drilling, breaking rock or concrete, compacting soil, and more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>7. Articulated Frame</h2>
            <p>Many backhoes feature an <strong>articulated frame</strong>, which allows them to pivot in the middle, providing excellent maneuverability in tight or confined spaces. This design enables the backhoe to work effectively on uneven terrain or in restricted areas, making it a practical choice for urban construction and landscaping.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>8. Stabilizers</h2>
            <p><strong>Stabilizers</strong>, or outriggers, are located on the sides of the backhoe and are extended when digging to provide stability. These support the machine, reduce movement, and ensure safety while digging or lifting heavy loads with the backhoe arm.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>9. Compact Size</h2>
            <p>Unlike large excavators and loaders, backhoes are <strong>relatively compact</strong>, allowing them to access smaller job sites and work in confined areas where larger equipment cannot fit. Their size makes them a popular choice for smaller-scale construction projects, landscaping, and municipal work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <h2>10. Mobility</h2>
            <p>Backhoes are designed with <strong>four-wheel drive</strong> and are easily mobile across different types of terrain. This mobility makes them suitable for a wide range of environments, from rough, off-road construction sites to smooth paved areas. Many models come with a <strong>road transport mode</strong>, allowing them to be driven between job sites on public roads.</p>
