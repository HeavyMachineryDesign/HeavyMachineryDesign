        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>A backhoe, often called a backhoe loader, is a versatile piece of heavy machinery widely used in construction, excavation, and landscaping. It combines the functionality of two essential tools: a tractor-like loader on the front and a hydraulic excavator arm on the back, which allows it to handle a range of tasks effectively.</p>
  
 <p>Backhoes are also known as:</p>

        <h1>Key Features</h1>
        <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Dual Functionality:</strong> Combines a <strong>front loader</strong> and a <strong>backhoe arm</strong>, enabling tasks like digging, scooping, lifting, loading, and carrying materials.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Backhoe Arm:</strong> Located at the rear, it uses a boom, stick, and bucket powered by a <strong>hydraulic system</strong> for precise excavation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Loader Bucket (Front Loader):</strong> Designed for scooping and lifting materials like soil and debris, it also fills holes and clears spaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Operator Cab with Pivoting Seat:</strong> Allows the operator to switch between loader and backhoe operations easily without moving the machine.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hydraulic System:</strong> Provides strength and precision for lifting and digging heavy loads and operating attachments smoothly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Attachments Compatibility:</strong> Compatible with <strong>augers, hydraulic hammers, rippers, and compactors</strong>, expanding its versatility.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Articulated Frame:</strong> Enhances maneuverability, allowing the backhoe to pivot in tight spaces or on uneven terrain.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stabilizers:</strong> Located on the sides, they extend during digging to provide stability and ensure safety when handling heavy loads.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Compact Size:</strong> Ideal for smaller job sites and confined areas where larger equipment cannot operate.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mobility:</strong> Equipped with <strong>four-wheel drive</strong> for diverse terrain and road transport mode for easy movement between job sites.
    </li>
</ul>
