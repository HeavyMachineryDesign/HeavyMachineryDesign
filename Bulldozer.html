                    <h3>Early Development</h3>
                   <strong>Late 19th Century:</strong> The concept of using a tractor with a blade for earthmoving began to emerge. Steam-powered tractors were among the first machines to perform similar functions, but they were limited in efficiency and power.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>1920s: The Birth of the Bulldozer</h3>
                    <strong>1923:</strong> The term "bulldozer" became widely used, referring specifically to a tractor fitted with a large, heavy blade. The first true bulldozer was developed when a detachable blade was added to a tractor, enabling it to push earth and debris.
                    <strong>Caterpillar:</strong> In 1925, Caterpillar introduced the first modern bulldozer by attaching a blade to its crawler tractors, enhancing their utility in construction and agriculture.
