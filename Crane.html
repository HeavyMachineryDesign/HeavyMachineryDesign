        <h1>Crane</h1>
        <p>Cranes are vital pieces of heavy machinery used for lifting, moving, and positioning heavy loads in various construction, manufacturing, and shipping applications. They come in several types, each designed for specific tasks and environments.</p>

        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boom:</strong> The long arm that extends out to lift and move loads. The boom can be fixed or telescopic.</li>
            <li><strong>Cab:</strong> The operator's compartment, which may be located at the top of the crane or in a separate structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Counterweights:</strong> Heavy blocks placed on the opposite side of the load to balance the crane and prevent tipping.</li>
            <li><strong>Hook and Sling:</strong> Used to attach the load being lifted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Uses:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Essential for lifting building materials, such as steel beams, concrete panels, and heavy machinery.</li>
            <li><strong>Shipping:</strong> Used at ports to load and unload shipping containers and heavy cargo from ships.</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Commonly found in factories to move heavy items between workstations.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Used for tasks like installing or maintaining tall structures, such as communication towers.</li>
        </ul>
