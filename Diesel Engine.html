    </section>

    <section id="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages of Diesel Engines</h2>
        <p>The benefits of diesel engines in heavy machinery are numerous, particularly in areas such as fuel efficiency, durability, and power output.</p>

        <ul>

    </section>

    <section id="operation">
        <h2>How Diesel Engines Operate</h2>
        <p>Diesel engines operate on the principle of compression ignition, unlike gasoline engines that use spark plugs. In a diesel engine, air is compressed within the cylinder, which raises its temperature to a point where the injected fuel spontaneously ignites. This process results in the high power output required for heavy machinery. Key components of a diesel engine include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cylinders</strong>: Where fuel and air are mixed and compressed to generate power.</li>
            <li><strong>Fuel Injectors</strong>: Deliver precise amounts of diesel fuel into the cylinders for combustion.</li>
            <li><strong>Crankshaft</strong>: Converts the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion to drive the machinery.</li>
            <li><strong>Turbochargers</strong>: Increase the amount of air entering the engine, improving efficiency and power output.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling and Lubrication Systems</strong>: Keep the engine at optimal operating temperatures and reduce friction between moving parts.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="advancements">
        <h2>Advancements in Diesel Technology</h2>
        <p>Over the years, diesel engine technology has evolved to improve efficiency, reduce emissions, and enhance reliability. One of the most notable advancements in recent years is the introduction of <strong>emission-reduction systems</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)</strong>: This system recirculates a portion of the engine's exhaust back into the intake air to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)</strong>: This technology injects a urea-based solution (AdBlue) into the exhaust stream to break down harmful nitrogen oxides into harmless nitrogen and water vapor.</li>
            <li><strong>Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF)</strong>: These filters capture particulate matter (soot) from exhaust gases, preventing them from being released into the atmosphere.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="challenges">
