        <h1>Drilling Rig</h1>
        <p>A drilling rig is a machine used to create boreholes in the ground. It is commonly used for oil and gas exploration, geothermal energy, and water wells. Drilling rigs can be mobile or fixed and are equipped with various tools to perform drilling operations efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drill Bit:</strong> The cutting tool used to break rock and soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Provides the necessary energy for the drilling process, often through engines or generators.</li>
            <li><strong>Hoisting System:</strong> Lifts and lowers the drill string and other equipment into the borehole.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling System:</strong> Keeps the drill bit cool during operation to prevent overheating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Uses:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oil and Gas Exploration:</strong> Essential for locating and extracting hydrocarbons.</li>
            <li><strong>Geothermal Energy:</strong> Used to access hot water and steam from the earth's crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Wells:</strong> Provides access to underground water sources for drinking and irrigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Drilling:</strong> Used for soil sampling and testing in environmental assessments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Drilling Rigs:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>1. Land Rigs</h3>
