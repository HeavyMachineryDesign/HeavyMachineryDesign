        <h1>History</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Early Manual Drilling:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Before internal combustion engines, drilling was powered by human or animal muscle.</li>
                <li>The technique of percussion drilling originated in the Han dynasty (c. 100 BC) in China to extract natural gas.</li>
                <li>Chinese methods used iron bits, bamboo poles, and long woven bamboo cables, with men jumping on levers to operate.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Advancements in Depth:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Early Han dynasty wells reached up to 10 meters; by the 10th century, wells reached around 100 meters.</li>
                <li>By the 16th century, Chinese drilling technology allowed for wells over 2,000 feet (610 meters) deep.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Global Influence:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Chinese well drilling technology spread to Europe in 1828.</li>
                <li>American businessman Edwin Drake adapted a modernized version of Chinese cable tool drilling with steam engines to drill Pennsylvania's first oil well in 1859.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cable Tool Drilling and Early Oil Industry:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cable tool drilling was effective for brine wells, often producing natural gas.</li>
                <li>Drake's use of cable tool drilling led to commercial oil production, with kerosene as the primary product.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Roller Bits and Reverse Circulation (RC) Drilling:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In the 1970s, roller bits, using mud circulation, were largely replaced by RC drills in non-oil applications.</li>
                <li>RC drilling, using pneumatic reciprocating pistons, enabled faster and deeper drilling.</li>
                <li>Improvements in metallurgy have allowed for harder bits and higher air pressures, further enhancing RC drilling efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Diamond Drilling:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Diamond drilling, primarily used in mineral exploration, has remained effective and largely unchanged since its inception.</li>
                <li>It remains one of the best methods for cutting hard rock formations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
