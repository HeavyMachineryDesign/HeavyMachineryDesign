<p>An excavator is a versatile piece of heavy machinery primarily used for digging, lifting, and moving materials. It typically consists of a boom, arm, bucket, and a rotating cab mounted on a tracked or wheeled undercarriage.</p>

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Boom and Arm:</strong> The boom provides reach, while the arm controls the bucket's depth and angle.</li>
        <li><strong>Bucket:</strong> Various attachments can be used, such as digging buckets, grapples, or hammers, depending on the task.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotating Cab:</strong> Allows the operator to rotate the machine 360 degrees for increased maneuverability.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracks or Wheels:</strong> Tracks provide stability and traction on uneven terrain, while wheels can allow for faster movement on solid surfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Uses:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digging:</strong> Used for trenching, foundation excavation, and general earthmoving.</li>
        <li><strong>Demolition:</strong> Equipped with attachments like hydraulic breakers for tearing down structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Material Handling:</strong> Used to lift and move heavy materials on construction sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Landscaping:</strong> Helpful in shaping land and moving large amounts of soil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Excavators:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crawler Excavators:</strong> Have tracks for stability and are suitable for rough terrain.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheeled Excavators:</strong> Faster and more maneuverable, suitable for urban environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Mini Excavators:</strong> Smaller, more compact machines ideal for tight spaces and smaller jobs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Excavators are essential in construction, mining, and many other industries due to their versatility and power.</p>
