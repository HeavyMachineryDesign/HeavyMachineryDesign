        <h1>Excavator</h1>
        <p>An excavator is a versatile piece of heavy machinery primarily used for digging, lifting, and moving materials. It typically consists of a boom, arm, bucket, and a rotating cab mounted on a tracked or wheeled undercarriage.</p>

        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boom and Arm:</strong> The boom provides reach, while the arm controls the bucket's depth and angle.</li>
            <li><strong>Bucket:</strong> Various attachments can be used, such as digging buckets, grapples, or hammers, depending on the task.</li>
            <li><strong>Rotating Cab:</strong> Allows the operator to rotate the machine 360 degrees for increased maneuverability.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracks or Wheels:</strong> Tracks provide stability and traction on uneven terrain, while wheels can allow for faster movement on solid surfaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Uses:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digging:</strong> Used for trenching, foundation excavation, and general earthmoving.</li>
            <li><strong>Demolition:</strong> Equipped with attachments like hydraulic breakers for tearing down structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Material Handling:</strong> Used to lift and move heavy materials on construction sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Landscaping:</strong> Helpful in shaping land and moving large amounts of soil.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Excavators:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crawler Excavators:</strong>
        Mounted on tracks for stability and mobility on rough terrain. Ideal for construction, mining, and large-scale earthmoving projects.

            </li>

            <li><strong>Wheeled Excavators:</strong>
                Equipped with wheels instead of tracks, allowing for faster movement on paved surfaces. Suitable for urban construction and road maintenance.
                <img src="wheeled excavator.jpg" alt="Wheeled Excavator">
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mini Excavators:</strong>
                Smaller and more compact, ideal for tight spaces and smaller jobs. Often used for landscaping, small construction projects, and residential work.

            </li>

            <li><strong>Long Reach Excavators:</strong>
                Feature extended booms and arms for increased reach and digging depth. Commonly used in applications like dredging and deep excavation.

            </li>

            <li><strong>Suction Excavators:</strong>
                Use high-powered vacuum systems to remove soil and debris. Ideal for non-destructive digging and utility work.

            </li>

            <li><strong>Demolition Excavators:</strong>
                Equipped with specialized attachments for demolition tasks, like shears or hydraulic hammers. Designed for breaking down structures efficiently.

            </li>

            <li><strong>Dragline Excavators:</strong>
                Use a large bucket suspended from a boom to drag and scoop material. Commonly used in mining and large-scale earthmoving.
