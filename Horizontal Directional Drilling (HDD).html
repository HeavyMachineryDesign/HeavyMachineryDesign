        <h1>About:</h1>
        <p>Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) is a trenchless technology used to install underground pipes, cables, and conduits without the need for traditional open excavation. HDD is often used for installing utilities across roads, rivers, or other difficult terrains where digging a trench would be impractical or disruptive.</p>

        <h2>Working Principles:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pilot Hole:</strong> The process starts by drilling a small pilot hole along the desired path. A drill bit is guided horizontally underground, typically using a combination of tracking and steering mechanisms to ensure it stays on course.</li>
            <li><strong>Reaming:</strong> After the pilot hole is drilled, it is enlarged by pulling a reamer (a larger cutting tool) back through the hole. This process widens the hole to the required size for the installation of the pipe or conduit.</li>
            <li><strong>Pipe Installation:</strong> A new pipe or cable is then pulled through the enlarged hole. The pipe may be attached to the reamer or a specialized pulling head, which is pulled back through the hole, pulling the pipe with it.</li>
            <li><strong>Completion:</strong> After the pipe is installed, the entry and exit points are restored, and the utility is connected to the necessary infrastructure.</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimal Surface Disruption:</strong> Since it doesn‚Äôt require extensive digging, HDD reduces the environmental impact and surface disturbance.</li>
            <li><strong>Access to Difficult Terrain:</strong> HDD can be used under rivers, roads, railways, and other obstacles.</li>
            <li><strong>Time and Cost Efficiency:</strong> In many cases, HDD can be quicker and less costly than traditional methods that involve digging long trenches.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="applications">
        <h2>Common Applications:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Installing water, gas, and sewer pipes.</li>
            <li>Placing fiber optic cables and other telecommunications lines.</li>
            <li>Crossing roads, railways, rivers, and environmentally sensitive areas.</li>
