<h1>Key Equipment Groups</h1>
<p>Heavy equipment usually comprises five equipment systems: the implement, traction, structure, power train, and control/information.</p>

<div class="system">
    <h2>1. Implement</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The implement is the attachment or component that performs the specific task for which the equipment is designed.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Implements are crucial for carrying out various operations such as digging, lifting, grading, or hauling.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Buckets: Used with excavators and loaders for digging and transporting material.</li>
            <li>Blades: Found on bulldozers for grading and leveling surfaces.</li>
            <li>Hammers: Hydraulic hammers attached to excavators for breaking concrete or rock.</li>
            <li>Forks: Used on forklifts to lift and move pallets or heavy loads.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="system">
    <h2>2. Traction</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The traction system provides the equipment with mobility and stability, enabling it to navigate various terrains.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> It determines how the machine moves and maintains grip on the surface.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Tracks: Used in tracked excavators and bulldozers for stability on soft ground.</li>
            <li>Wheels: Found on wheeled loaders and trucks, offering higher speeds on solid surfaces.</li>
            <li>Tires: Specially designed for off-road conditions, such as all-terrain tires on forklifts.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="system">
    <h2>3. Structure</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The structure encompasses the frame and support elements that give the equipment its strength and durability.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> It must withstand the stresses of operation, including weight loads and impacts.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Chassis: The base frame of a machine, like that of a backhoe loader.</li>
            <li>Cab: The enclosed area where the operator sits, designed for safety and visibility.</li>
            <li>Boom: The extended arm of an excavator that provides reach and leverage for digging.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="system">
    <h2>4. Power Train</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The power train is the system responsible for generating and transmitting power from the engine to the wheels or tracks.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> It converts fuel into mechanical energy, enabling the equipment to perform its tasks.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Engine: Diesel engines are common in heavy equipment for their power and efficiency.</li>
            <li>Transmission: Transmits the engine's power to the wheels; can be automatic or manual.</li>
            <li>Hydraulic Systems: Used in excavators and loaders to power attachments and functions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="system">
    <h2>5. Control/Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> This system allows the operator to control the equipment and monitor its performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> It includes the user interface, sensors, and feedback mechanisms that help manage the machine efficiently.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Control Levers: Used to operate various functions, such as raising or lowering the implement.</li>
            <li>Displays: Digital screens showing important information like engine temperature and fuel levels.</li>
            <li>Sensors: Monitor parameters like load weight and system performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Understanding these systems is crucial for effective operation and maintenance of heavy machinery.</p>
