     <section id="key features">
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
                <li><strong>Large Buckets:</strong> Loaders are equipped with sizable buckets designed to scoop, carry, and dump various materials such as dirt, sand, gravel, and debris efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Powered Engines:</strong> Loaders are powered by robust diesel engines that provide the necessary torque and horsepower to handle heavy loads and operate in demanding conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydraulic Systems:</strong> Loaders use advanced hydraulic systems to control the movement of the bucket and lift arms, allowing for precise control and efficient operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Articulated Steering:</strong> Many loaders feature articulated steering, which enables the front and rear sections to pivot independently for improved maneuverability in tight spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Four-Wheel Drive (4WD):</strong> Loaders typically come with 4WD for better traction and stability on rough or uneven terrain.</li>
                <li><strong>Operator Cabin:</strong> Modern loaders have enclosed, climate-controlled cabins with ergonomic controls, digital displays, and enhanced visibility for operator comfort and safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick-Attach Systems:</strong> Loaders can accommodate various attachments such as forks, grapples, and snowplows, making them versatile for different tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Durable Construction:</strong> Loaders are built with heavy-duty frames and components to withstand the stresses of tough working environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety Features:</strong> Loaders are equipped with features like rollover protection systems (ROPS), seat belts, backup alarms, and lighting systems to enhance safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel Efficiency:</strong> Newer loaders incorporate fuel-efficient technologies to reduce emissions and operating costs while maintaining high performance.</li>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <ul>
                <li><strong>Construction Sites:</strong>
                    <p>Loaders are used extensively in construction projects to transport and load materials such as sand, gravel, concrete, and bricks. They are essential for site preparation, backfilling, and material distribution, enabling faster and more efficient project completion.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Road Work:</strong>
                    <p>During road construction and maintenance, loaders clear debris, move asphalt, and transport aggregates. They are often used to spread materials evenly before paving and to assist in repairs by transporting heavy loads of construction material.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mining Operations:</strong>
                    <p>In mining sites, loaders handle large quantities of extracted minerals, rocks, and soil. They are used to load dump trucks for transport and to clear excavation sites. Track loaders, in particular, are preferred for their stability on rough terrain.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong>
                    <p>Farmers rely on loaders for moving feed, soil, hay, and manure. Loaders are also used for clearing fields, building trenches, and handling heavy agricultural equipment, making them essential for modern farming operations.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Snow Removal:</strong>
                    <p>In regions with heavy snowfall, loaders equipped with snowplow attachments efficiently clear roads, driveways, and parking lots. Their ability to lift and transport large amounts of snow helps maintain accessibility during winter conditions.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Landscaping:</strong>
                    <p>Loaders are used in landscaping projects to move soil, mulch, rocks, and plants. Their precision and versatility make them ideal for creating gardens, leveling ground, and installing features like retaining walls.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Demolition:</strong>
                    <p>In demolition projects, loaders clear debris, transport broken materials, and assist with site cleanup. Their powerful engines and durable build allow them to handle heavy and bulky waste effectively.</p>
                </li>

 <section id="Common-uses">
      <h2>Early Beginnings (Late 19th Century - Early 20th Century)</h2>
        <p>Before loaders, material handling was done manually with simple tools like shovels, carts, and horses. The first mechanized loaders came into play with steam-powered shovels, which were large machines used for digging and loading materials in the 1830s. These early machines laid the foundation for modern loaders.</p>

        <h2>Introduction of the Front-End Loader (1930s)</h2>
        <p>In the 1930s, the front-end loader emerged as the first true loader. These machines were powered by diesel engines and featured large buckets at the front, which were ideal for lifting and moving loose materials. The use of hydraulic systems made these loaders more efficient and versatile than earlier machines.</p>

        <h2>Post-World War II Era (1940s - 1950s)</h2>
        <p>After World War II, loaders became widely adopted in the construction industry. The combination of better hydraulics and diesel engines made loaders more reliable. The first skid steer loader, developed by Melroe Manufacturing (now Bobcat), revolutionized smaller construction tasks with its compact size and ability to maneuver in tight spaces.</p>

        <h2>Technological Advancements (1960s - 1980s)</h2>
        <p>During this period, articulated loaders were developed, offering better maneuverability. The hydraulic systems of loaders continued to improve, increasing their power. New attachments like forks and grapples made loaders even more versatile across various industries.</p>

        <h2>Modern Loaders (1990s - Present)</h2>
        <p>Telehandlers, also known as boom loaders, became a staple in construction during the 1990s, as they could lift materials to great heights. Today, loaders come equipped with advanced technologies like GPS, automation, and hybrid power systems, making them more efficient and environmentally friendly.</p>
