    <section>
        <h2>Installation Process</h2>
        <p>The installation of pavers involves several key steps to ensure a stable and long-lasting surface:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Site Preparation:</strong> The area must be cleared of vegetation and debris, and the ground should be leveled.</li>
            <li><strong>Base Layer:</strong> A base layer of gravel is laid to provide stability and drainage, followed by a sand layer to help level the pavers.</li>
            <li><strong>Laying Pavers:</strong> Pavers are arranged in the desired pattern, ensuring tight joints and alignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Compaction:</strong> Once the pavers are laid, a compactor is used to set them into the sand bed, followed by adding joint sand to fill gaps.</li>
            <li><strong>Finishing Touches:</strong> Edges are secured, and the surface is cleaned to remove any excess sand.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
