        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>
            A rotary drill rig comprises several key components that work in harmony to achieve efficient drilling.
            At its core is a rotating drill bit, powered by a robust system of motors and hydraulics. This bit is
            attached to a drill string, which transmits the rotational force necessary to penetrate the ground. The
            rig's mast or derrick provides vertical support, allowing the drill string to reach significant depths.
            Advanced rigs also incorporate automated systems for steering and monitoring, ensuring precise operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the defining features of rotary drill rigs is their ability to drill through various materials,
            from loose soil to solid rock. This capability is enhanced by specialized drill bits, such as roller-cone
            or polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits, tailored for specific geological conditions. Additionally,
            modern rigs use drilling fluids to cool the drill bit, remove cuttings, and stabilize the borehole.
