 <section id="History">
     <h1>History:</h1>
 <h2>1. Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>The concept of scrapers originated with primitive tools used by humans to dig and move soil. Early agricultural practices required basic wooden or stone tools to level land for farming.</p>

        <h2>2. Animal-Powered Scrapers (19th Century)</h2>
        <p>In the 1800s, scrapers began to take shape as animal-drawn implements. The <strong>Fresno Scraper</strong>, invented in 1883 by James Porteous, was a U-shaped bucket pulled by horses or oxen, widely used for agricultural development, irrigation, and road construction.</p>

        <h2>3. Mechanization (Early 20th Century)</h2>
        <p>The industrial revolution introduced steam-powered scrapers, which were later replaced by gasoline and diesel engines in the 1920s for better efficiency and mobility.</p>

        <h2>4. Motorized Scrapers (1930s-1940s)</h2>
        <p>Companies like Caterpillar and LeTourneau introduced rubber-tired scrapers and self-propelled models, marking a significant advancement. During World War II, these machines were widely used for constructing airstrips and military infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>5. Post-War Boom (1950s-1970s)</h2>
        <p>Massive infrastructure projects increased demand for larger and more efficient scrapers. Tandem-powered scrapers with two engines became popular for handling heavy workloads.</p>

        <h2>6. Modern Innovations (1980s-Present)</h2>
        <p>Modern scrapers now feature hydraulic systems, GPS technology, and automation for enhanced precision and efficiency. Eco-friendly hybrid and electric models are also emerging to reduce environmental impact.</p>

        <h2>7. Current Use and Trends</h2>
        <p>Scrapers are integral to construction, mining, and agricultural projects, with a focus on smart systems and sustainability.</p>
