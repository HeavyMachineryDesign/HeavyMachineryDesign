 <section id="chassis">
        <h2>Chassis or Main Frame</h2>
        <p>The chassis or main frame serves as the backbone of heavy machinery, providing support for all other components such as the engine, transmission, and hydraulic systems. It must be sturdy enough to handle the stress of lifting, digging, or moving heavy loads.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Material:</strong> Constructed from high-tensile steel or other heavy-duty materials that offer high resistance to stress and strain.</li>
            <li><strong>Weight Distribution:</strong> Designed for optimal weight distribution to ensure that the machine remains balanced during operations, especially on uneven terrain.</li>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> The chassis is designed to withstand not just the static weight of the components but also dynamic forces from machine movement and external loads.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Found in most heavy machinery like cranes, excavators, bulldozers, and loaders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The chassis is integral to the machine‚Äôs performance, ensuring that all other components are properly supported and aligned for safe operation.</p>

    <section id="mast">
        <h2>Mast or Derrick</h2>
        <p>The mast or derrick is a vertical support structure, primarily used in cranes, to lift heavy loads. It allows the machine to extend vertically and horizontally to reach higher points or greater distances.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Can be fixed, telescoping, or folding, providing different lifting height options. Telescoping masts are particularly useful in cranes for high-reach tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydraulic Actuation:</strong> Many modern masts use hydraulic systems to raise and lower the mast, allowing for precise control of height and angle.</li>
            <li><strong>Load Capacity:</strong> The strength and material of the mast are designed to handle the weight of extremely heavy loads, often with safety factors built into the design.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Commonly used in tower cranes, rough terrain cranes, and other large lifting equipment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The mast or derrick is essential for lifting, lowering, and positioning loads with maximum efficiency and safety.</p>

    <section id="arm">
        <h2>Arm</h2>
        <p>The arm is the long, articulated part of an excavator or crane that connects the boom to the working attachment (such as a bucket, hammer, or auger). The arm is crucial for digging, lifting, and precise material handling.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydraulic Power:</strong> Hydraulic actuators are used to control the movement of the arm, allowing for flexible and precise positioning of tools and attachments.</li>
            <li><strong>Materials:</strong> The arm is usually made of reinforced steel to handle the stress of lifting heavy materials or digging into the earth.</li>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> The arm is designed for maximum reach, strength, and flexibility, ensuring that operators can maneuver heavy loads in a variety of settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Found in backhoes, excavators, and material handlers, where precise movement of materials is necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The arm allows the machine to handle heavy loads with precision and flexibility, making it an indispensable component in many construction and mining applications.</p>
