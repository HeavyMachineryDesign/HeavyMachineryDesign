        <h2>Ancient and Medieval Periods: Foundations of Mechanization</h2>

        <h3>Early Tools and Simple Machines (c. 3000 BCE)</h3>
        <p>Civilizations in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China used simple tools like levers, pulleys, ramps, and inclined planes to build massive structures, such as the Pyramids of Giza.</p>
        <p>Roman and Greek innovations like the crane (e.g., the treadwheel crane) enabled the lifting of heavy stones.</p>

        <h3>Water Wheels and Mill Technology (200 BCE - 1200 CE)</h3>
        <p>Water wheels powered early mechanical processes like grinding grain and sawing wood.</p>
        <p>These early machines laid the groundwork for mechanized power systems.</p>

    <section id="industrial">
        <h2>Industrial Revolution (18th - 19th Century): Birth of Heavy Machinery</h2>

        <h3>Steam Power and Mechanization</h3>
        <p>James Watt's improvements to the steam engine (1760s) revolutionized power generation.</p>
        <p>Steam engines began to power textile mills, locomotives, and ships.</p>

        <h3>Invention of Early Excavators and Loaders</h3>
        <p>The first mechanically powered excavator, the "Steam Shovel," was patented by William Otis in 1839.</p>
        <p>These machines were crucial for large-scale mining and railroad construction.</p>

        <h3>Metalworking and Industrial Machinery</h3>
        <p>Advances in metallurgy allowed for stronger iron and steel parts.</p>
        <p>Development of lathes, milling machines, and presses led to mass production of machine components.</p>

    <section id="early-20th">
        <h2>Early 20th Century: Rise of Modern Construction and Agricultural Machinery</h2>

        <h3>Internal Combustion Engines (Late 19th - Early 20th Century)</h3>
        <p>The invention of gasoline and diesel engines made heavy machinery more portable and efficient.</p>
        <p>Companies like Caterpillar and John Deere pioneered modern tractors and earth-moving equipment.</p>

        <h3>Construction of Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Roads, canals, and dams required bulldozers, graders, and excavators.</p>
        <p>Hoover Dam (1930s) and other massive projects showcased the capabilities of modern machinery.</p>

        <h3>Military Innovations</h3>
        <p>World War I and II accelerated developments in tank and armored vehicle technology.</p>
        <p>Post-war, these innovations adapted to civilian uses, such as bulldozers and loaders.</p>

    <section id="mid-20th">
        <h2>Mid-20th Century: Specialized Machinery and Automation</h2>

        <h3>Hydraulic Systems</h3>
        <p>The introduction of hydraulics (fluid power) allowed for precise and powerful control of machinery.</p>
        <p>Hydraulic excavators, cranes, and loaders became more versatile and efficient.</p>

        <h3>Diversification and Specialization</h3>
        <p>New machinery for mining, tunneling, and road paving emerged.</p>
        <p>Specialized vehicles like the backhoe loader and skid-steer loader were developed.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="late-20th">
        <h2>Late 20th to 21st Century: Technological Advancements</h2>

        <h3>Computerization and Automation</h3>
        <p>Integration of GPS, computer systems, and sensors improved efficiency, safety, and precision.</p>
        <p>CNC (Computer Numerical Control) technology revolutionized manufacturing processes.</p>

        <h3>Environmental Concerns and Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Development of cleaner engines, electric machines, and hybrid systems to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>Focus on fuel efficiency, noise reduction, and environmental impact.</p>

        <h3>Remote Operation and Robotics</h3>
        <p>Remote-controlled and autonomous machinery are used in mining, construction, and agriculture.</p>
        <p>Drones and AI-based systems enhance surveying and monitoring tasks.</p>
