        <h2>What is Heavy Machinery?</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the world of heavy machinery. Heavy machinery refers to large, powerful equipment used in construction, mining, and other industrial applications. These machines are designed to perform tasks that require significant strength and precision.</p>

        <h2>Why is it called Heavy Machinery?</h2>
        <p>Heavy machinery is called so because these machines are designed to perform tasks that require significant power and strength, typically involving heavy materials or large-scale operations. The term "heavy" refers to their size, weight, and capacity to handle substantial loads, making them essential in industries like construction, mining, and manufacturing. Examples include excavators, bulldozers, and cranes, all of which are built to withstand tough working conditions and heavy usage.</p>
</section>

      <section id="Significance">
        <h2>Difference Between Heavy Machinery and Standard Machines</h2>
        <p>Heavy machinery is different from standard machinery for several key reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Size and Weight:</strong> Heavy machinery is larger and heavier, designed to handle substantial loads and withstand tough working conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Power and Capacity:</strong> These machines have powerful engines and hydraulics to perform demanding tasks, such as digging, lifting, and transporting heavy materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Heavy machinery is built with robust materials to endure harsh environments, frequent use, and the physical stress of heavy operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Many heavy machines are designed for specific tasks, like excavation, demolition, or material handling, making them more efficient for those purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Features:</strong> Due to their size and the risks involved, heavy machinery often includes advanced safety systems to protect operators and workers on site.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Heavy machinery typically requires specialized training to operate, given their complexity and the potential hazards involved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These differences make heavy machinery essential for industries like construction and mining, where they can efficiently handle large-scale tasks.</p>
