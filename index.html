   <section id="key-elements">
    <h2>Key Elements in Heavy Machinery</h2>
    <p>Heavy equipment usually comprises five elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <!-- Implement Section -->
        <li>
            <strong>Implement:</strong> 
            <p>This is the tool or attachment that performs the work, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bucket for Digging:</strong> Used for excavating soil, sand, or other materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Blade for Grading:</strong> Used for leveling surfaces, spreading materials, or shaping terrain.</li>
                <li><strong>Forks for Lifting:</strong> Used for handling pallets, beams, and other heavy items.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydraulic Hammer:</strong> Used for breaking concrete, rock, or other hard materials.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Implements can be swapped based on the task at hand, providing versatility and efficiency for different operations.</p>
        </li>

      <!-- Traction Section -->
<li>
    <strong>Traction:</strong>
    <p>
        The <strong>traction system</strong> is crucial for enabling heavy machinery to move efficiently and maintain stability on a variety of surfaces. It encompasses the wheels, tracks, and related components that ensure the machine maintains grip, supports heavy loads, and operates effectively in diverse and challenging conditions.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Wheels:</strong>
            <p>
                Wheels are typically used for machinery that operates on firm, paved, or relatively even terrain. They provide high-speed mobility and are easy to maintain.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rubber Tires:</strong> Common in construction equipment like loaders and backhoes. They offer good traction on roads and are suitable for urban environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Pneumatic vs. Solid Tires:</strong> Pneumatic (air-filled) tires offer cushioning and shock absorption, while solid tires are puncture-resistant and suitable for rough terrain.</li>
                <li><strong>All-Terrain Tires:</strong> Designed with deep treads to enhance grip on uneven or muddy surfaces.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Tracks:</strong>
            <p>
                Tracks provide greater stability and traction for machines operating on soft, loose, or uneven ground, such as mud, sand, or rocky terrain.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steel Tracks:</strong> Durable and highly resistant to wear, making them ideal for rugged environments like construction sites, mining, and forestry.</li>
                <li><strong>Rubber Tracks:</strong> Offer flexibility, reduced ground damage, and quieter operation. These are often used on compact equipment like mini excavators.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Tracks:</strong> Distribute weight over a large surface area, preventing the machine from sinking into soft ground and improving overall stability.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Hybrid Systems:</strong>
            <p>
                Some heavy machinery combines both wheels and tracks to achieve the advantages of both systems. For example, wheeled excavators can be equipped with outriggers or track-like attachments to increase stability during operation.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Key Considerations for Traction Systems:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Surface Conditions:</strong> Choose wheels for hard, even surfaces, and tracks for soft, uneven, or loose terrain.</li>
                <li><strong>Load Capacity:</strong> Tracks provide better weight distribution, making them suitable for heavier loads.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Wheels are easier and less costly to maintain, while tracks require regular inspection and maintenance to avoid breakdowns.</li>
                <li><strong>Maneuverability:</strong> Wheels offer superior speed and turning capabilities, whereas tracks offer better stability on slopes or rough terrain.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
